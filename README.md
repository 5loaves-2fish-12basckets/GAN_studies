# GAN studies

The goal of this study is to reproduce easy to follow GANs in pytorch, and to create my own GAN related side projects!

    --projects
        --music             to create music with GAN!

currently focusing on:  
**reschedule for slower pace**
* continue reproduction: finish DCGAN, finish InfoGAN
* understand InfoGAN
* make music!!!
